Hey there! My name is Maddy and I love design, people, drawing, travelling, and conquering my fears! 

### More Information

I started this blog as a way to share a few things that I generally keep to myself. 

I am an Australian girl studying and interning in Germany for a year, and my experiences have me thinking at 1000km/hr. 
I am an anxious person in new situations especially, and I wanted to share a few of my ups and downs along the way. 
This is a very honest blog in which I aim to be as true as possible. I would like to post a range of things, including drawings, 
design experimentation, blog entries, tips on dealing with anxiety, lessons learnt, and "quacking" in interesting places. You will see...
So please feel free to join me on my adventure, I would love to have you along for the ride. It could be a bit of a bumpy one knowing me, 
but that is all part of the fun, right?
Yours truly,
Maddy xxx
