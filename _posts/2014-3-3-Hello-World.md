Guten abend/morgen/tag fruenden, 


Hier ist meine nummer eins blog post! Tomorrow marks 4 months of me being away from my sunny little city (Brisbane) and all its beautiful little people. I am currently travelling at 900km/hr over Alluitsup Paa (which I think is part of Greenland? Or maybe Iceland?). I am on my way to Canada for Christmas and have been on exchange in Germany for 3 months, in a small city called Karlsruhe. It has been indeed an amazing experiencing, and I am fully aware of how privileged I am and my awareness of this is growing exponentially by the day. I admit that it has taken a bit of time to grow this appreciation. I think for the first 2 months on my own in Germany, I was in some form of shock/constant anxiety. However, with every form of struggle comes a lot of growth- and I believe that I have emerged a stronger, wiser butterfly!! (if I do say so myself) 


For now, I have decided that I will start writing a little blog combining a few things which I adore, being pretty photos, art, and a bit of writing about psychology, people, culture, language, travel and the world. The purpose of this blog is currently a little bit undefined – but it has something to do with expressing the exhilarating and artistic process of growing up and venturing into the big wide world, and recording lessons learnt, mistakes made, and memories created. Das ist alles (that is all). I aim to be very honest and authentic. 


I usually write this in a diary – but recently (being today), I thought, what is the harm of exposing my somewhat hectic mind to the universe to try something new? I am a bit of an over sharer anyway, so nothing too new. 
Yours truly,


Honest Maddy xxx
